            {% if goal == "Lean Bulk" and level_name == "Advanced" %}

                <p>Based on your level which you described as <b>{{level_name}}</b>, your kcal surplus should be {{kcal_surplus}} higher than you total daily expenditure, which is: {{ tdee }}.
                Why {{ kcal_surplus }} ? As an <b>{{level_name}}</b>, your marge of progression is significantly reduced compared to a beginner. Gaining muscle at your level is more difficult than when you started
                and your chance of gaining fat are, in the contrary, higher now when having a caloric surplus for bulking, as you almost reached your muscular genetic potential. Going slowly and analyzing how
                things go is key here.</p>

                <p>We would recommend however to adjust that number as weeks pass and changes occur. For example, if you progress for the first month and then hit a plateau, you might consider adding another 5% calories intake and see how it goes. Everybody is different and needs can greatly vary between individuals!</p>
            
            {% elif goal == "Lean Bulk" and level_name == "Intermediary" %}

            <p>Based on your level which you described as <b>{{level_name}}</b>, your kcal surplus should be {{kcal_surplus}} higher than you total daily expenditure, which is: {{ tdee }}.
                Why {{ kcal_surplus }} ? As an <b>{{level_name}}</b>, your marge of progression is still great. You have less chances of storing fat than an advanced individual as your body will make a better use of the nutritents for building muscles, instead of storing it as fat whenever he can.</p>

                <p>We would recommend however to adjust that number as weeks pass and changes occur. For example, if you progress for the first month and then hit a plateau, you might consider adding another 5%-10% calories intake and see how it goes. Everybody is different and needs can greatly vary between individuals!</p>

                Why {{ kcal_surplus }} ? As an <b>{{level_name}}</b>, your marge of progression is immense. You have less chances of storing fat than an advanced individual as your body will make a better use of the nutritents for building muscles, instead of storing it as fat whenever he can. Of course, if you stimulate protein synthesis through regular workouts and great alimentation still.</p>

            <!--Recomp texts-->
            {% if goal == "Recomposition" %}
                <p>Your Goal is to do a <b>{{ goal }}</b>, so your daily kcal intake should be the same as the amount your body consumes everyday, which is: <b>{{kcalgoal}} kcals</b>.
                    In order to make your recomposition a success, make sure to reach the amount of protein recommended everday. 
                </p>

            <!--Cut texts-->
            {% if goal == "Cut" %}
            <p>Your Goal is to <b>{{ goal }}</b>, so your daily kcal intake is based on deficit of {{ deficit }} from your total daily energy expenditure which is {{ tdee }} kcals. That's where the {{ kcalgoal }} kcals comes from. This deficit is based on your actual bodyfat ( {{ bodyfat }}% ), the bigger it is, the bigger the deficit should be at the beginning, and vice versa if your bodyfat is very low, your deficit should be very low too.</p>


            <p>
                In order to make your cut a success, make sure to reach the amount of protein recommended everday to avoid any muscle protein consumption from your body. You body will prioritize energy consumption during a cut, and the 
                biggest energy consumer in the body are muscles. That's why your body will try get rid of the muscles before even touching the fat that is, in fact, a safe storage in case of a "famine" to survive. 
                To trick your body to convince it to keep muscles and start burning fat, you will need to make sure to stimulate enough protein synthesis with regular workouts and by giving your body enough protein to avoid losing muscle during your cut.

                Something else you could do is to add some cardio sessions during the week to increase your caloric consumption, if you like doing cardio.
                If you don't like cardio, going out for a walk everyday and doing 10,000 steps can greatly increase your energy expenditure and thus, help with your cut. Moreover, it will be less aggressive on your articulations and might benefit your mental health!
