                                        biggest energy consumer in the body are muscles. That's why your body will try get rid of the muscles before even touching the fat that is, in fact, a safe storage in case of a "famine" to survive. 
                                        To trick your body to convince it to keep muscles and start burning fat, you will need to make sure to stimulate enough protein synthesis with regular workouts and by giving your body enough protein to avoid losing muscle during your cut.

                                        Something else you could do is to add some cardio sessions during the week to increase your caloric consumption, if you like doing cardio.
                                        If you don't like cardio, going out for a walk everyday and doing 10,000 steps can greatly increase your energy expenditure and thus, help with your cut. Moreover, it will be less aggressive on your articulations and might benefit your mental health!
